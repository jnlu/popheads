Album: Anti
Consideration ft. SZA: 9 Very unconventional yet fitting opener that sets the mood just right
James Joint: 8
Kiss It Better: 9.5 The guitar riff slays me every time tbh
Work ft. Drake: 10 I went from loving this track to feeling indifferent towards it and then back to absolutely loving it again. Rih and Drake have great chemistry, I enjoy pretty much all of their collabs even if their subject matter is always the same
Desperado: 10
Woo ft. Travis Scott: 8 I don't get why so many people hate this song, it sounds great and fits the album's mood super well imo
Needed Me: 10 Used to be my favorite ANTI track, but I overplayed it way too hard. Still amazing though and deserves the full 10 points
Yeah, I Said It: 8
Same Ol' Mistakes: 9
Never Ending: 9
Love on the Brain: 10 Every time this track comes on I just want to belt the lyrics alongside Rih, it's great. Some of her live performances of this song are amazing as well!
Higher: 8.5
Close to You: 8.5
Goodnight Gotham: 9 I still think this deserves to be a full-length track tbh
Pose: 8.5
Sex With Me: 9
Album: Lemonade
Pray You Catch Me: 7
Hold Up: 7
Don't Hurt Yourself ft. Jack White: 6.5
Sorry: 6.5 I really liked this one when I first heard, but it got old old very quickly...
6 Inch ft. The Weeknd: 7 Honestly, I think Abel completely overshadows Bey in this track, which is unfortunate.
Daddy Lessons: 3 Stick to pop
Love Drought: 9 I love listening to this song late at night while I'm lying in bed, it's so soothing
Sandcastles: 0 Oh god, the shrieking on this track... it's probably supposed to sound super emotional and shit, but it's just straight up grating... "WhAaAaaAAAT is it ABOuT YuHOuhOUOUuOU!?!?"
Forward ft. James Blake: 6
Freedom ft. Kendrick Lamar: 8
All Night: 8 KISS UP AND RUB UP AND FEEL UP ON YA
Formation: 10 Easily the best track on Lemonade. That beat goes hard and even if the lyrics are corny and repetitive, Bey just makes it WORK.
Album: Glory
Invitation: 8
Make Me...ft. G-Eazy: 8.5 On the one hand, I'm honestly not too fond of this guy, but on the other, I feel like the song kinda needed something to mix things up a bit - and even if he does look absolutely yucky in the MV, his verse on this track honestly isn't THAT bad imo...
Private Show: 8 I know that this song is a mess and that Britney sounds like Kermit the frog, but it's just so damn catchy... WERK IT WERK IT
Man On The Moon: 9.5 Very cute song and definitely in my Top 3 of the album
Just Luv Me: 8
Clumsy: 8 Again - I know this song is a total mess, but it gets stuck in my head every time and I love every second of it. Cluuuumsy, bangin' all oooover this bedroom
Do You Wanna Come Over?: 8.5 Yes I do
Slumber Party: 10 Yas Mama Britney, give Baenash>E< that well deserved promo! BUY NIGHTRIDE ON ITUNES
Just Like Me: 8
Love Me Down: 8
Hard To Forget Ya: 8.5
What You Need: 8.5
Better: 9
Change Your Mind (No Seas Cortes): 10 Probably my favorite off the album, why is this a Deluxe Track?
Liar: 8.5
If I’m Dancing: 8.5
​Coupure Electrique: 7 Ngl, Britney's french is pretty cute
Mood Ring: 10 Why isn't this on the Standard Edition of Glory???
Album: Joanne
Diamond Heart: 8.5
A-Yo: 9.5 This tracks honestly just makes me want to get up and dance, it's so energetic!
Joanne: 8.5
John Wayne: 10 Underappreciated bop, this goes even harder than both A-Yo and Dancin' In Circles imo
Dancin’ In Circles: 9
Perfect Illusion: 11 I don't care what anyone says, I still absolutely love this track. It's still my most scrobbled song on lastfm and never fails to get me hyped up.
Million Reasons: 7.5
Sinner’s Prayer: 9
Come To Mama: 8

FourFiveSeconds: 10 2 of my favorite artists collaborating with some no-name hobo who's probably just a huge fan of theirs, really warms my heart tbh
Bitch Better Have My Money: 9.5
American Oxygen: 9
Daddy Lessons ft. Dixie Chicks: 3 Nothing can save this mess
Pretty Girls: 8
Angel Down (Work Tape): 8
Million Reasons (Work Tape): 8
Rise: 6.5 You tried
I Don't Wanna Live Forever: 1 Oh my God, please just STOP it you moldy-ass piece of stale white bread. One of the most boring and generic songs released by a big artist this year, Rise sounds like a masterpiece compared to this... thing. If it wasn't by Taylor no one would even give this one a second listen, I guarantee it
Towards the Sun: 10 Very underappreciated track imo, possibly because it's from the soundtrack to a kid's movie. It's just so atmospheric!
